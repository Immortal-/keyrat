This is the client.
A few features to implement:
1. Keylogger
2. Any other feature you may thinkg of?
3. Make it look nicer?
4. We need to make sure its putting itself in startup and hiding the process.

Each window procedure is split up into its own .cpp file, and our header crap is in client_project.h keep things clean ya know?
Feel free to comment, bash, flame, as long as you keep your language to an appropriate level.
